# Instructions

I have added index.html inside assessment-vejitha folder, which will have two buttons leading to their respective exercise.


Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

# Answer
Because the increment (++) operater in the middle tries to add the first result(ba) to last string(a), but "ba" is not a number so it will return 'NAN'.
Hence 'ba' + 'NAN' + 'A' is resulted  in lowercase as banana.
